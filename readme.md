## Rotating calipers
Numba and CUDA implementations of computational geometry algorithms such as convex hull (giftwrapping) and minimum rotated bounding box (rotating calipers). Animations are generated using [vispy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) (I can share this code if there is interest).

Code is very messy (sorry).
